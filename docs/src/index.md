# RadialBasisFunctions.jl

Documentation for [RadialBasisFunctions](https://github.com/kylebeggs/RadialBasisFunctions.jl).

This package intends to provide tools for all things regarding Radial Basis Functions (RBF). 

| Feature | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| Interpolation | ✅ |
| Regridding | ✅ |
| Partial derivative ($\partial f$) | ✅ |
| Laplacian ($\nabla^2 f$, $\Delta f$) | ✅ |
| Gradient ($\nabla f$) | ✅ |
| Directional Derivative ($\nabla f \cdot v$) | ✅ |
| Custom / user supplied ($\mathcal{L} f$) | ✅ |
| divergence ($\textrm{div} \mathbf{F}$ or $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$) | ❌ |
| curl ($\nabla \times \mathbf{F}$) | ❌ |
| Reduced Order Models (i.e. POD) | ❌ |

Currently, we support the following types of RBFs (all have polynomial augmentation by default, but is optional)

| Type                 | Function, $\phi(r)$                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Polyharmonic Spline  | $r^n$ where $n=1,3,5,7$          |
| Inverse Multiquadric | $1 / \sqrt{(r \varepsilon)^2+1}$ |
| Gaussian             | $e^{-(r \varepsilon)^2}$               |


where $\varepsilon$ is a user-supplied shape parameter.

## Installation

Simply install the latest stable release using Julia's package manager:

```julia
] add RadialBasisFunctions
```

## Current Limitations

1. A critical dependency of this package is [NearestNeighbors.jl](https://github.com/KristofferC/NearestNeighbors.jl) which requires that the dimension of each data point is inferrable. To quote from NearestNeighbors.jl:
    > The data, i.e., the points to build up the tree from. It can either be
    > * a matrix of size nd × np with the points to insert in the tree where nd is the dimensionality of the points and np is the number of points
    > * a vector of vectors with fixed dimensionality, nd, which must be part of the type. Specifically, data should be a Vector{V}, where V is itself a subtype of an AbstractVector and such that eltype(V) and length(V) are defined. (For example, with 3D points, V = SVector{3, Float64} works because eltype(V) = Float64 and length(V) = 3 are defined in V.)

    That said, we currently only support the second option here (`Vector{AbstractVector}`), but plan to support matrix inputs in the future.

2. `Interpolator` uses all points, but there are plans to support local collocation / subdomains like the operators use.
